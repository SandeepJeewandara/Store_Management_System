  ## Product Description

  This GUI Application was created to manage dealers and item data in an effective and user-friendly manner. The application's functionality allows users to see and filter objects by category with ease, while also streamlining the process of adding, removing, and updating item information. The program also has a random dealer selection option that allows to choose four dealers at random and display their information ordered by location. To build a reliable and maintainable system, this project makes use of Java programming and object-oriented design and analysis techniques.
